	        <p> The nations and their respective space agencies, universities, science communities, <br> 
			    industrial complexes, governments, militaries, and various numerous private and public <br>
			    organizations, from all over our planet Earth have united together in our Planet's desire, <br>
				mandate, necessity, and endeavor, to travel to and to explore, our own Milky Way Galaxy, <br>
				as well as the other awesome and amazing and astounding entities, beyond our own Galaxy, <br>
				even to the other galaxies and the other entities that surround us! <br>
		    </p>
		    <p>&quot;Impossible In Our Time and Level of Technological, Scientific, Industrial, etc., Sophistication&quot;, <br>
				one might understandably say. But, in recent months, several &quot;newsearch&quot; &amp; &quot;provelopment&quot; <br>
			    (&quot;research&quot; &amp; &quot;developmen&quot;") monumental discoveries and breakthroughs have emerged! <br>
			    Involving the discovery and expanding understanding, of energy resources and dimensions, <br>
			    heretofore unknown, unproven, un-imagined, speculated about, theorized, and hoped for, <br>
			    Humankind has emerged into a frontier and a transcendent and new relationship, with the <br>
			    Omniverse that surround Us. In summary: it will Now be possible to carefully and accurately <br>
			    manipulate space, gravity, time, energy, matter, etc., so to carefully and accurately define, <br>
			    create, maintain, control, navigate, and reproduce at will, non-destructive, energy-demanding <br>
			    but energy-efficient, hyper-pathways, enabling nearly instantaneous relocation to Any Location, <br>
			    Whatsoever, throughout our Omniverse! 
			<p>
				Here is just one uplifting example of a &quot;Sister Galaxy&quot;, very similar to o\ur Milky Way Galaxy, <br>
			    that we will be able to efficiently and transcendently travel to and from!
